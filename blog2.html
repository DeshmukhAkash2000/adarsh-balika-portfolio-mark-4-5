    <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 1rem;">The <strong>problem of unemployment</strong> is the <strong>most serious problem.</strong> people are willing to work but they cannot get it. There is unemploymentin cities, towns and even in villages. There are some <strong>causes of unemployment</strong> in India. <strong>1)Overpopulation</strong>  of the country, which brings competition in all professionals sectors.
      <strong>Second</strong> one reason is <strong>the ineffective education system</strong> which fails in the proper development of a student as a proffesional employee with complete kwoledge including theoretical information and practical experiences. <strong>Third</strong> reasons is underdeveloped rural areas from where people are moving towards the developed urbon areas for finding a job or other professional career. <strong>Fourth</strong> reason is underdeveloped bussiness sectors are still not an atrraction for tudents as working place like the agriculture field and cottage industries.
      <strong>Fifth</strong> reason is criteria of selecting candidates with having experience rather than fresher, this leads to thhe to the problrm of unemployment.
    </p>

    <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 1rem;">There are lot of reason of unemployment but there are some solutions for solving unemployment problem as well. There should be a check on the rapid growth of population</strong> The programme of family planning should be made more popular in rural areas.  <strong>The system of education sould be given to tecnical and vocational education.</strong> Education should be sound and practical. <strong>Government should create jobs in all sector.</strong>  
     <strong>Banks should approve loan for youth faster to establish new bussiness.</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 1rem;">
        The national crisis of unemployment affects a huge population including youth. Thus the result of unemployment coes in the form of the undevelopement of nation. Though the government has taken too many steps regarding remove this problrm from India but still could not be able to get complete succss. It's time for people of India along with the government to become together and face this problem with unit.
