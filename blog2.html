       <Strong>Diplomacy</Strong> has existed since the beginning of the human race. The act of conducting negotiations between two persons, or two nations at a large scope is essential to the upkeep to international affairs.
       Among the many functions of diplomacy, some include <strong>preventing war and violence, and fortifying relation between two nations.</strong> Diplomacy is most importantly <strong>used to complete a specific agenda.</strong>

    For the upkeep of the International System, diplomacy is used in every corner of the world. <strong>Without it many nations would not be able to conduct successfull negotiations.</strong> While many are not able to find a clear beganning or creation of diplomacy, modern diplomacy has become much more advanced and many aspects have chenged over the years. 
    <strong>The Peace of Westphalia 1648 created the first modern Congress in addition to creating a new world order in central Europe based on state sovereignty.</strong> Much of Europe began to change after the introduction of modern diplomacy.
