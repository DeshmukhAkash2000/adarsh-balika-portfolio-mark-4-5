    <h1 style="color: indigo;">The Function of<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 179);">Diplomacy</span></h1>
    <p>
        <Strong>Diplomacy</Strong> has existed since the beginning of the human race. The act of conducting negotiations
        between two persons, or two nations at a large scope is essential to the upkeep to international affairs.
        Among the many functions of diplomacy, some include <strong>preventing war and violence, and fortifying relation
            between two nations.</strong> Diplomacy is most importantly <strong>used to complete a specific
            agenda.</strong>
        Therefore without diplomacy, much of the world's affairs would be abolished, international organisation would
        not exist, and above all the world would be at a constant state of war It is diplomacy that certain countries
        can exist i harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
        There has not been a documented start of diplomacy; however there have been instances ranging back to
        <strong>the 5th century where diplomacy arose in certain nations.</strong> Dating abck to <strong>432 B.C. the
            Congress of Sparta</strong> was an "illustration of diplomacy as <strong>organized by the Greek City
            States"</strong>
        The origine of the word "diploma" comes from different side of the earths. In Greece diploma meant "folded in
        two", while in Ancient Rome thr word was used to describe travel documents. Often times the word diplomacy is
        given many many meanings. Many times will the words "policy" and the word "negotiation" be seen as synonyms;
        hence <strong>the word
            "diplomacy" and "foreign diplomacy" are deemed to be similar.</strong> These "synonyms" of diplomacy are all
        faulty. While they may be very similar in some cases, they are not the exactly the same. <strong>Sir horald
            Nicolson</strong> who was <strong>an English Diplomat</strong> born in Tehran,Persia, states :
    </p>


    <pre style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; font-size: 120%;">              "Diplomacy is neither the invention nor the pastime of some particular political system, but is an essential element
               in any reasonable relation between man and man and between nation and nation."
   </pre>
    <p>
        For the upkeep of the International System, diplomacy is used in every corner of the world. <strong>Without it
            many nations would not be able to conduct successfull negotiations.</strong> While many are not able to find
        a clear beganning or creation of diplomacy, modern diplomacy has become much more advanced and many aspects have
        chenged over the years.
        <strong>The Peace of Westphalia 1648 created the first modern Congress in addition to creating a new world order
            in central Europe based on state sovereignty.</strong> Much of Europe began to change after the introduction
        of modern diplomacy. For example, <strong> "France under Cardinal Richelieu indroduced the modern approach to
            international relations, based on the nationstate and motivated by national
            interest as it's ultimate purpose."</strong> The New World Order began to bloom in all of <strong>Central
            and Western Europe.</strong> Great Britain argued for the <strong>"balance of power"</strong> which kept
        European diplomacy alive for the next 200 years. Every contry in Europe contributed a little to the diplomacy.
        The balance of powers theory that many famous realists such as <strong> Francsesco Sforza, Machiavelli,
            and Guiciardini</strong> argued was and still is an essential component of modern diplomacy. Throughout the
        course of history diplomacy has been a paramount element in the upkeep of peace and in the creation of positive
        change. Without diplomacy much of the world‚Äôs affairs would not exist. There are many examples of how diplomacy
        has affected countries, and even individual citizens. An example of how negotiation positively
        can affect someone is Clinton‚Äôs negotiation with Kim Jung Il in North Korea. Their peaceful negotiation resulted
        in the release of two American citizens. An example of how power can corrupt diplomacy is Libya and Switzerland.
        With the introduction of power, in other words oil, countries such as Libya with the leader Ghaddafi are able to
        have a stronger presence in the world and say things that can normally not be said.
        If diplomacy were not in existence, international organizations would not exist. The world would be at a
        constant state of war, and war would in fact never end because they normally end with diplomatic negotiations.
