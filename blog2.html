    <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 1rem;">The problem of unemployment is the most
        serious. people are willing to work but they cannot get it. There is unemployment in cities, towns, and even in
        villages. There are some causes of unemployment in India. 1)Overpopulation of the country, which brings
        competition in all professional sectors. The second reason is the ineffective education system which fails in
        the proper development of a student as a professional employee with complete knowledge including theoretical
        information and practical experiences. The third reason is underdeveloped rural areas from where people are
        moving towards the developed urban areas for finding a job or other professional career. A fourth reason is
        underdeveloped business sectors are still not an attraction for students as working place like the agriculture
        field and cottage industries. A fifth reason is the criteria of selecting candidates with having an experience
        rather than fresher, this leads to the problem of unemployment.</p>

    <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 1rem;">There is a lot of reason for
        unemployment but there are some solutions for solving the unemployment problem as well. There should be a check
        on the rapid growth of population The program of family planning should be made more popular in rural areas. The
        system of education should be given to technical and vocational education. Education should be sound and
        practical. Government should create jobs in all sectors. Banks should approve the loan for youth faster to
        establish new businesses.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 1rem;">
        The national crisis of unemployment affects a huge population including youth. Thus the result of unemployment
        comes in the form of the development of a nation. Though the government has taken too many steps regarding
        removing this problem from India but still could not be able to get complete success. It's time for the people
        of India along with the government to become together and face this problem with the unit.
