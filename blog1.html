    <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 1rem;"><strong>Childhood</strong> is the
        happeist period of
        one's life. childhood is the best age in human's life, it is said that a child comes from heaven. The earth acts
        as a foster mother to him and offers all the beauriful temptations and allurements to humour him. It is a
        carefree age when no one has any about anything.Old people say that childhood is best part of life. They back at
        their childhood and remember all itts happy days. Perhaps these old folks are right.
        And yet they forget many things that were not so pleasant in their childhood.There is funny story that tellsd
        you of a boy who was crying because he had to go back to school after the holidays and the father scolded him. A
        child is loved and taken care of by his parents
        The parents try thrir best that they should eat the best food, wear the best clothes and gets the best education
        they can afford.
        It has been called the golden period of one's life. The sweet memories of childhood stick the one's memory like
        a pleasand dream. It was amazing time. I have so many memories,
    </p>
    <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">In my childhood I had no responsibility. I got
        everything without doing anything. My every wish was readily fulfilled. I enjoyed perfectly freedom. Nobody took
        offend.
        Even my meaningless worlds would be a source of joy to my parents. I was very credulous in my childhood. I was
        as innocent as a lamb. I was howver, very curious by nature. I was always eager to know
        everything. But gone are the days of childhood. only sweet recollections of that golden period are left would
        that i would child again.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 5.5rem;">One day in my school, the
        competition related to general kwoledge was held. I was not prepared for this.
        But my elder sister trust me that I will prepare questions easily. She helped me foe learn questions in a short
        period. Next day I participate in competition and gave all answers very frequently and correct. I selected as a
        winner and get prizes and wishesh for doing well. I never forgot the scenes when all the people, childrens see
        towards me I was so happy. My father prouds me, that is my son.
        It was possible only because of my parents and elder sister. I always missed my childhood memories.</p>
