    <hr>

    <p><strong>Wolf Warrior Diplomacy</strong> describes an aggresive style of diplomacy adopted by <strong>Chinese
            diplomates</strong> in the 21th century under Chinese leader
        <strong> Xi jinping's</strong> administration. The term was coined from a Rambo-style Chinese action film wolf
        worrier 2. This style contrasts to prior Chinese diplomatics
        practices that were maximized as "Taoguange Yanghuai" means "cover light and nurture in the dark, or keep a low
        profile" by <strong>Deng Xioping</strong>, which had emphasized
        the avoidence of controvercy and the use of cooperative rhetoric. This chengyu("idiom") is an abbreviation of
        Deng's stretegy <strong>"observe calmly,secure our position, cope
            with affairs calmly, hide our capacities and bide our time,be good at maintaining a low profile, and never
            claim leadership." </strong> Wolf worrior diplomacy is confrontational
        and combative, with its proponents loudly denouncing any criticism of China on social media and in interview. As
        an attemp to gain "discource power" in international politics,
        Wolf warrior diplomacy forms one part of a new foreign policy stretegy called Xi jinping's <strong>"major
            Country Diplomacy"</strong> which has legitimized a more active role
        China on the world stage, including engaging in open <strong>ideological</strong> competition with the
        <strong>west.</strong>


        <p>Altough the phrase "wolf warior diplomacy" was only popularized as a desciption of this diplomatic approach
            during the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic,</strong> the appearance of wolf
            warriors-style diplomates had begun a few years prior. Chinese leader and General Secretary of the Chinese
            Communist Party <strong> Xi Jinping's foriegn policy</strong> writ large,
            percieved anti-China hostilty from the west among Chinese government officials, and shifts within the
            Chinese diplomatic bureaucracy have been cited as factors leading to its emergence.</p>

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Wolf warrior diplomacy by Chinese diplomates use of confrontational rhetoric as well as diplomates increased
            willingness to rebuff criticism of China and court controvercy in interviews and
            on social media. <strong> it is departure from former Chinese foriegn policy,</strong> which focused on
            <strong>working behind the scenes, avoiding controvercy and fovoring a rhetoric of international
            cooperation, exemplified by the maxim China "must hide its strength" in international diplomacy.</strong>
            This change reflect a larger change in how the Chinese government and the CCP relate and interact with the 
            larger world. Efforts aimed at incorporating <strong>the Chinese diaspora</strong> into China's foreign policy have also intensified 
            with an emphasis placed on <Strong>ethnic loyalty over national loyalty.</Strong>
        </p>

        <p>Wolf Worrier Diplomacy began to started in <strong>2017</strong>, although components of it had already been incorporated into Chinese diplomacy before then.
            An assertive diplomatic push resembling wolf warrior diplomacy was also noted following the <strong>Great Recession.</strong> The emergence of wolf warrior diplomacy has 
            been tied to <strong> Xi Jinping's political ambitions, as well as percieved anti-china hostility from the west amongst government officials</strong>
            </p>

        <p>One factor which may have helped bring about wolf warrior diplomacy was the addition of a public relation section to internal employee performance reports. This incentivised Chinese diplomats to be active 
            on social media and give controvercsial interviews. Additionaly, a younger cadre of diplomats that worked its away up the ranks of the Chinese diplomatic service and this generational shifts is also seen as accounting 
            for part of the change. Activity on social media was greately increased and the tone of social media engagement became more direct and confrontational. China says wolf worrior Ddiplomacy <strong>is a "neccesary" response
            to Western diplomats social media presence. </strong> More specifically, <strong>foreign vice-minister Le Yucheng</strong> says he believes that foriegn countries <strong>"are comming to our doorstep, 
            interfering in our family affairs, constantly nagging at us,insulting and discrediting us [so] we have no choice but to firmly defend our national interest and dignity.""
            </strong>

        <p> Chinese diplomats engaged in wolf warrior during the <strong>2020 olympics</strong> with issue being taken with the way Chinese athlets were being depicted by the media and by the Taiwanese team being introduced 
            as "Taiwan" instead of <strong>Chinese Taipei.</strong> The Chinese consulate in new york city complained that NBC had used an inaccurate map of china in their coverage because it didn't include <strong>Taiwan and South China Sea</strong>.

            <hr>
        <p>Wolf Worrior diplomacy has often garnered a strong response and in some cases has provoked a backlash against China and specific diplomats.
            By 2020, <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> was reporting that <strong>the rise of wolf worrior diplomacy had left many politicians and bussiness people feeling targeted. </strong>
           An October 2020 survey by <strong>Pew Reaserch Centre</strong> found that <strong>78% of people</strong> in Western nations have <Strong>"not too much or no confidence in China's leadership</Strong> 
           to do the right thing regarding world affairs. In December 2020, <strong>Nicholas Chapuis, an ambassador of the European Union to China</strong> warned :"What happened during the last year is a massive distruption
           or reduction in support in Europe, and elsewhere in the world, about China. And i'm telling that toall my chinese friends, you need to seriously loo at it"

        </p>
        <p>When China threatened Milos Vystrcil, the president of Czech Repiublic's Senate, for addressing Taiwan's national legislature, Reporyje mayor Pavel Novotny called <strong>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi a Chinese "wolf warrior diplomat"</strong>
